# Standard Template Library
The Standard Template Library(STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common data structures. One can easily implement data structures like stack, queue, list and using STL reduces programming time as well. 

The C++ STL grouped into following three categories
1) Sequences              - Vector, List, Doubly ended queue<br/>
2) Container Adapters     - Stack, Queue, Prority queue<br/>
3) Associative Containers - Bitset, Set, Multiset, Map, Multimap 

Usage of several STL classes are illustrated. For convenience and ease of learning, examples are also provided along with syntax.
