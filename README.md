# Standard Template Library
STL is the standard template library which contains C++ template classes. STL is a powerful tool and it reduces programming time with rich implementations of freuently used data structures and algorithms. Important parts of the STL are as follows:

Containers - includes container classes to store and manipulate data elements.
Algorithms - includes important techniques like sorting, searching.
Miscellaneous - includes string class and other functions.

Usage of several STL classes are illustrated. For convenience and ease of learning, examples are also provided along with syntax.
